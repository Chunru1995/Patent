A highly reducing gas is formed in the lower portion of the bed from partial combustion of the fuel in admixture with the primary fluidizing air.

The concurrent use of such reducing and oxidizing zones permits reducing conditions to be maintained which favor a high rate of decomposition even though these conditions favor the formation of CaS as well as CaO. The undesirable CaS, which would otherwise be discharged with the CaO product is eliminated by circulation of the fluidized particles through the oxidizing zone.

US6017381,"Collection of particles from a gas stream and the separation of dissimilar particles from a gas stream by a field effect auxiliary gas cyclone (FEAGC) is enhanced by providing an inductive field that attracts or repels particles and an auxiliary gas system that complements the field effect by providing an additional independent internal control for particle velocity, particle concentration, and system delta p. The FEAGC has three adjustable operating variables: (1) an auxiliary high pressure air input orifice located in the cyclone input which is used to increase the product velocity while reducing the solids to gas ratio; (2) an electric field between the cone and the vortex that subjects charged particles to either an attractive or repelling field; and (3) an auxiliary air venturi located in the inlet of the vortex to control the delta p and to control the operating temperature of the vortex and insulating materials. Controlling these variables is done by optically monitoring changes in the particle concentration at the exit end of the vortex outlet and automatically adjusting the auxiliary air inlets and the high voltage. The FEAGC is effective for separating particles that average less than 5 microns in diameter.",collect particl ga stream separ particl ga stream field effect ga cyclon feagc is enhanc provid field attract repel particl ga system complement field effect provid control particl veloc particl concentr system p feagc ha oper variabl pressur air input locat cyclon input is use increas product veloc reduc solid ga ratio field cone vortex subject charg particl field air venturi locat inlet vortex control delta p control oper temperatur vortex insul materi control variabl is done monitor chang particl concentr end outlet adjust air inlet voltag feagc is separ particl averag micron diamet
